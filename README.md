Project Description:
    At Georgia Tech, we are committed to sustainability, but air travel, one of the biggest culprits of carbon emissions, is currently missing from all current carbon calculations. Our team is proposing a system that will generate detailed and accurate reports of flight related carbon footprint based on simple expense reports. It will allow any Georgia Tech user to easily view reports for individual departments or the Institute as a whole, promoting openness and accountability on our path to carbon neutrality.
